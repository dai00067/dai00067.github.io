                        <p>
                            Born in 1994 in Zhejiang Province, China. Having won the first place in the middle school
                            entrance examination, I was successfully admitted to Dongyang No. 1 Middle School, a key
                            high school in the city. I graduated from Zhejiang University of Technology, a key
                            university in the province. While studying, I actively participated in students'work. I did
                            not let myself fail the course. I succeeded in getting the CET6 certificate, taking
                            part-time jobs on campus and being the first person in charge of a school-level
                            organization.

                            In 2015, the senior year mainly focused on internship. During this period, I constantly
                            tried to find my own professional position, from the new media operation to Android
                            development,and to iOS development. Finally, I formally contacted with the front-end
                            development in February 2016. After graduation in June 2016, I worked as a full-time
                            front-end development engineer, and went further and further on the road of front-end
                            development, and fell deeper and deeper until I fell in love with this profession. In 2016,
                            when the front-end field of three-legged (React/Vue/Angular), technological innovation is
                            surging, and I was so young, high-spirited!

                            At work, I am belong to introverted and quiet, while those in life, I am outgoing and
                            lively. Usually, I always love to do things more seriously. I am more willing to pursue the
                            essence of things to help me understand things. My favorite motto is that "Know what it is,
                            know why it is, and know what it will be".
